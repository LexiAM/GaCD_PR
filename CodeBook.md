Feature Descriptions
========================================================

The features selected for this data table come from data collected by the UCI Human Activity Reconginition study. In this study the accelerometer and gyroscope measurements were collected. "DataAverage.txt" file contains the averaged measurement data per each human subject (30 subjects) and type of activity (6 types of activity) for a total of 180 observations. Each observation is labeled with: subject's ID number ("Subject ID"), Activity Type Label ("Activity") and corresponding Activity Name ("ActivityName"). All remaining variables contain **averages** of the mean and standard deviation of raw time domain signals and additional Fast Fourier Transforms of some of the signals. The list of signals is shown below:

Time_Domain_Body_Acceleration-XYZ  
Time_Domain_Gravity_Acceleration-XYZ  
Time_Domain_Body_Acceleration_Jerk-XYZ  
Time_Domain_Body_Gyroscope-XYZ  
Time_Domain_Body_Gyroscope_Jerk-XYZ  
Time_Domain_Body_AccMag  
Time_Domain_Gravity_Acceleration_Magnitude  
Time_Domain_Body_Acceleration_Jerk_Magnitude  
Time_Domain_Body_Gyroscope_Magnitude  
Time_Domain_Body_Gyroscope_Jerk_Magnitude  
FFT_Body_Acceleration-XYZ  
FFT_Body_Acceleration_Jerk-XYZ  
FFT_Body_Gyroscope-XYZ  
FFT_Body_Acceleration_Magnitude  
FFT_Body_Acceleration_Jerk_Magnitude  
FFT_Body_Gyroscope_Magnitude  
FFT_Body_Gyroscope_Jerk_Magnitude  

Each of the signals above has one of the following summary types:  
Mean  
Standard Deviation
